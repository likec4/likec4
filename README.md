## What is C4 Model?

The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.  
C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about C4 - check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.


## What is LikeC4? Why "like"?

C4 is great. But sometimes we need to go futher suggested levels and even have custom ones with our semantics.  
This is where LikeC4 comes in.

LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture. It might look like [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), though it is not
fully compatible.

With LikeC4 you have more flexibility, you can define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in your architecture model.  
This allows you to create a system design that is tailored to your specific needs and requirements.
