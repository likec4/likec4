## What is LikeC4? Why "like"?

LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture and tools to generate diagrams from the model.

LikeC4 is inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but provides some flexibility.
You customize or define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in architecture model.\
Perfectly tailored to your needs.
