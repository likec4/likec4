## What is LikeC4? Why "like"?

LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture, and tools to generate diagrams from the model.

LikeC4 is inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but provides some flexibility.
You customize or define your own notation, element types, and any number of nested levels in architecture model.  
Perfectly tailored to your needs.

## What does LikeC4 look like?

LikeC4 source ([full source on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/develop/docs/likec4/index-page/index-page.c4)):

</div>

CLI to generate react components (or export to other format):

```sh
likec4 codegen react -o likec4-generated.tsx
```

Website:

```tsx
import { LikeC4View } from '$/likec4-generated'

// ...
;<LikeC4View viewId='index' />
```

And this is rendered:
