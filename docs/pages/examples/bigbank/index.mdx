# Source Code

Let's take the [Big Bank C4 model](https://structurizr.com/dsl?example=big-bank-plc) by Simon Brown and convert it to LikeC4.

## Original

This is the original C4 model defined in Structurizr DSL.  
[open on structurizr](https://structurizr.com/dsl?example=big-bank-plc)

```structurizr showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/resources/structurizr.dsl filename="structurizr.dsl"
```

## LikeC4 Code

First, we define the specification and element types.  
[open on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/main/docs/likec4/_spec.c4)

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/_spec.c4 filename="_spec.c4" 
```


Now, copy-paste the model and views from Structurizr DSL.  
LikeC4 does not support the deployment views, so skip them.  
`views` also require some additional work, that is covered in the next sections.  
[open on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/main/docs/likec4/bigbank.c4)

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank.c4 filename="bigbank.c4" showLineNumbers
```
