# LikeC4 Code

This is the same Big Bank C4 model defined with LikeC4.  
The specification with similar element kinds:  

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/_spec.c4 filename="_spec.c4" 
```

LikeC4 language is partially compatible with Structurizr DSL.  
So we may copy-paste the `model` and `views` from it.  
Deployments are skipped as LikeC4 currently does not support that.  
`views` requires some additional work, this is covered in the next sections:

```likec4 showLineNumbers file=<rootDir>/likec4/bigbank/bigbank.c4 filename="bigbank.c4" showLineNumbers
```

Let's start with the [System Landscape](./landscape) diagram.
