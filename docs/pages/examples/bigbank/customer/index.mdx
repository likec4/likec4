# Personal Banking Customer

<Callout type='info' emoji='ℹ️'>
  The original C4 model does not have customer views.
</Callout>

LikeC4 has no view types and therefore any limits.  
We may visualize how customers interact with the system.

```likec4
views {

  view customer of customer {
    include
      *,
      customer -> internetBankingSystem.*,
      customer -> bigbank.*
    exclude webApplication
  }

}
```

The diagram:

<ExampleLikeC4View viewId='customer' />
