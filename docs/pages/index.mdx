<IndexPageSection title={'What is LikeC4? Why "like"?'}>    
  LikeC4 is a modeling language for describing software architecture, and tools to generate diagrams from the model.  
  Inspired by [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr DSL](https://github.com/structurizr/dsl), but with some flexibility.

You define your own notation, custom element types and any number of nested levels in the architecture model.  
 Perfectly tailored to your needs.

  Example of LikeC4 source ([full source on github](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/blob/develop/docs/likec4/index-page/index-page.c4)):

```likec4 filename="example.c4"
// customise model
specification {
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person
    }
  }
  element system
}

// describe the architecture
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    description 'Our product allows customers to manage their data'
  }

  customer -> saas 'uses to manage data'
}

// generate diagrams
views {
  view index {
    include *
  }
}
```

CLI to generate react components (or export to other formats):

```bash
likec4 codegen react -o likec4-generated.tsx
```

Somewhere in your code (optional):

```jsx
import { Embedded as LikeC4View } from '$/likec4-generated'

// ...
<LikeC4View viewId='index' />
```

And this is rendered (click to explore):
