### Quick Tutorial

To start with tutorial
- Web: open <Link className="nx-text-primary-600 nx-underline nx-decoration-from-font [text-underline-position:from-font]" href="/playground/blank/" target="_blank">blank playground</Link> in a new tab
- Local: [install vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=likec4.likec4-vscode)

and follow the steps:

<Steps>

### Tailor specification

We start with defining the element kinds we use in our model.  
For now, we need only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define the first elements

Start with top-level architecture elements

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {7-8} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add nested elements

Assume our system has two main components - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add a new kind to the specification and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Add relationships

Relationships describe the connections and interactions of the elements.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,17-18} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}
```

### Landscape view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).  
Let's add the Landscape view, i.e. bird's eye view of the architecture.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {23-25} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    include *
  }

}
```

We got this:

![landscape view](/getting-started/01.png)

<Info>
**Why there is a relationship?**

The relationships are implied from the nested elements.  
- `customer` has a known relationship with the nested `saas.ui` element

that implies
- `customer` has _some_ relationship with `saas`.  

</Info>

### Add more views

A View may have a root element `view of ...` as the initial scope.  
Then predicate `include *` is applied to the root element and includes nested elements.  
This is covered in more detail in [LikeC4 Language - Views](/docs/dsl/views).

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {29-31} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *
  }

}
```

Imagine, we zoom in on the `saas` element, and see nested elements and their relationships:

![saas view](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add a label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,45-47} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI fetches data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

The `saas` view after changes:

### Change model

Let's change the description of the `customer` and the label of `customer -> ui`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,31} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Our dear customer'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'enjoys our product'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

When we make changes, all views are updated automatically.

View `index`:

View `saas`:

### Try it yourself

Play with [this tutorial in playground](/playground/getting-started/) and try to add the following:

- change [shape](/docs/dsl/styling/#shape) of the `customer` element
- add a database (with `storage` shape) and tables like `customers` and `orders` (what relationships should be added?)
- add an external system, like Stripe, and show how the backend might interact with it

</Steps>
