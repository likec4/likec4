# Getting Started

Software systems evolve and architecture diagrams become outdated quite quickly, especially if drawn manually.

LikeC4 describes architecture as a single model and generates multiple architecture diagrams from different perspectives, like per use-case.
And any change, refinement or deprecation in the model is reflected automatically,
keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

## C4 Model

The [C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is a lightweight and practical approach for visualizing the architecture of a software system.  
It was developed by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/), a seasoned software architect and consultant.

C4 provides a set of diagrams that enable software architects and developers to communicate and document the structure, key elements, and interactions of the system.

If you never heard about it, check the [C4 Model website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.

LikeC4 inherits the simplicity of the C4 Model, with a focus on Architecture as Code approach, importing/exporting to various formats and documentation tools.

## What does LikeC4 look like?

Better to follow the [tutorial](#tutorial) to get the idea, but if you are impatient and want to try:

- Online playgrounds:
  - [Blank](/playground/blank/)
  - [Tutorial](/playground/getting-started/)
  - [BigBank Architecture](/playground/)
- Online with [github.dev](https://github.dev/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4)
- Online with [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/github/likec4/example-cloud-system/blob/main/model.c4)
- Install [official VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=likec4.likec4-vscode)

<Steps>

### Tailor specification

We start with defining the element kinds we want in our model.  
For now, we need only two - `actor` and `system`

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}
```

### Define the first elements

Start with top-level architecture elements

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {7-8} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS'
}
```

### Add nested elements

Assume our system has two main components - `ui` and `backend`.  
We add a new kind to the specification and update the model.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {4,10-11} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend
  }
}
```

### Add relationships

```likec4 showLineNumbers {13,14,17-18} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}
```

### Landscape view

View is a projection, a slice of the model defined by predicates (what to include/exclude).  
Let's add the Landscape view, i.e. bird's eye view of the architecture.

```likec4 showLineNumbers {23-25} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    include *
  }

}
```

We got this:

![landscape view](/getting-started/01.png)

<Callout type="info">
  **Why there is a relationship?**

The relationships are implied from the nested elements.  
`customer` has a relationship with the nested `saas.ui` element

</Callout>

### Add more views

A View may have a root element `view of ...` as the initial scope.  
Then predicate `include *` is applied to the root element and includes nested elements.  
This is covered in more detail in [LikeC4 Language - Views](/docs/dsl/views).

```likec4 showLineNumbers copy {29-31} filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui
    component backend

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend

    // Customer uses the UI
    customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *
  }

}
```

Imagine, we zoom in on the `saas` element, and see nested elements and their relationships:

![saas view](/getting-started/02.png)

### Enrich model

Let's add descriptions, define the shape of the `ui` and add a label to the relationship `ui -> backend`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,13-24,27,45-47} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'The regular customer of the system'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'opens in browser'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

The `saas` view after changes:

![saas view after changes](/getting-started/03.png)

### Change model

Let's change the description of the `customer` and the label of `customer -> ui`

```likec4 showLineNumbers {9,31} copy filename="getting-started.c4"
specification {
  element actor
  element system
  element component
}

model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'Our dear customer'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    component ui 'Frontend' {
      description 'Nextjs application, hosted on Vercel'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }
    component backend 'Backend Services' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and exposes as REST API
      '
    }

    // UI requests data from the Backend
    ui -> backend 'fetches via HTTPS'
  }

  // Customer uses the UI
  customer -> ui 'enjoys our product'
}

views {

  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'

    include *
  }

  view of saas {
    include *

    style customer {
      color muted
    }
  }

}
```

We made changes and all views are updated automatically.

`index` view:

![landscape view after changes](/getting-started/04.png)

`saas` view:

![landscape view after changes](/getting-started/05.png)

You can play with [this tutorial in playground](/playground/getting-started/) and, for example, add the following:

- change [shape](/docs/dsl/styling/#shape) of the `customer` element
- add a database (with `storage` shape) and tables like `customers` and `orders` (what relationships should be added?)
- add an external system, like Stripe, and show how the backend interacts with it.
