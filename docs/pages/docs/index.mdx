## What is LikeC4?

LikeC4 is a language, a DSL, that describes architecture as a single model and then compiled into multiple diagrams, from different perspectives and details.  

You have a _**single source of truth - your code**_.  
Any change, refinement or deprecation in the model is reflected automatically,
keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

### Why "like"?

<Info>
  If you never heard about _C4 Model_, check the [website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.
</Info>

LikeC4 inherits the simplicity of C4, but allows you to use your _own notation_, _your element types_ and any number of nested levels and detalization.  

Also, LikeC4 is a _**toolchain**_ that provides:

- architecture-as-a-code with native IDE support
- interactive and customizable React diagrams _in-the-box_
- CI/CD automation via CLI and GitHub Actions
- export to various formats:
  - PNG
  - HTML
  - Mermaid
  - D2
  - DOT (Graphviz)

You can use LikeC4 as a standalone tool or integrate it into your existing toolchain.

### What does LikeC4 look like?

```likec4 filename="example.c4"
// customise model
specification {
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person
    }
  }
  element system
}

// describe the architecture
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
  }

  saas = system 'Our SaaS' {
    description 'Our product allows customers to manage their data'
  }

  customer -> saas 'uses to manage data'
}

// generate diagrams
views {
  view index {
    include *
  }
}
```
