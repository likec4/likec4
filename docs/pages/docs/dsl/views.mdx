# Views

Views are the architecture diagrams, projections of the model from different perspectives, with different levels of details, like:

- System / service overviews
- Components interactions in specific use case
- Data flows and sequence diagrams

## View definition

Views may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced):

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {
  // with name
  view index {
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

<Info>
`index` is a special view, and is rendered by default if no view name is specified.  
If not defined, it will be generated for top-level elements
</Info>

Views may have a title, description, tags and links (same as [model element](./model#element)):

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view epic12 {
    #next, #epic-12
    title "Cloud System - Changes in Epic-12"
    description "
      This diagram shows the high-level
      components and interactions.
    "

    link https://my.jira/epic/12

    include *
  }

}
```

### View Root Element

View may have a root element (`view of ..`).  
Then it inherits the scope of the root element:

```likec4 filename="views.c4"
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'

    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```

## View predicates

View predicates define what elements/relationships to include/exclude.

```likec4
// include element
include cloud.backend

// or exclude
exclude cloud.backend

// include children of cloud.backend
include cloud.backend.*

// all incoming relationships
// if any found - includes cloud.backend and source elements
include -> cloud.backend
include * -> cloud.backend

// all outgoing relationships
// if any found - includes cloud children and target elements
include cloud.* ->

// all relationships from customer to cloud children
// if any found - includes customer and targeted children
include customer -> cloud.*

// elements by kind
include element.kind = container
include element.kind != system

// elements by tag
include element.tag = #next
include element.tag != #V2
```

<Info>
**Limitation**  
Relations with container elements are not rendered yet. Working on it...
</Info>

Wildcard may be used to reference "everything", but it depends on the context.

```likec4
view {
  // include all top level elements and their relationships
  include *
}

view of cloud.backend {
  // include 'cloud.backend', its children and all the incomings/outgoings
  // (relationships with the rest of the architecture)
  include *
}
```

Predicates are applied in same the order as defined in view.  
`exclude` applies only to elements/relationships included before.

```likec4
view {
  // rules may be merged
  include
    customer,
    bigbank,
    customer -> bigbank.*

  // include all children of bigbank
  include bigbank.*
  // but exclude webApplication
  exclude bigbank.webApplication
}
```

## Style rules

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  
Example from [BigBank](/examples/bigbank/components/):

```likec4
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to apiApplication and its descdendants
  style apiApplication, apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }

  // apply only to tagged elements
  style element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }
}
```
