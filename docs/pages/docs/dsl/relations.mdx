# Relationships

Relationships describe the connections and interactions of the elements,  
and created with the **`->`** operator:

```likec4
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  cloud = service 'Cloud'

  customer -> cloud
}
```

## Relationship kinds [#kind]

Relationships can be "kinded":

```likec4
specification {
  // Define a relationship kind in specifications
  relationship async
}

model {
  system1 = system 'System 1'
  system2 = system 'System 2'

  system1 -[async]-> system2
}
```

This allows us to express and add more semantics to the interactions between the elements, for instance, from a technology perspective (REST, GRPC, GraphQL, Sync/Async, etc.) or from a business perspective (delegation, inform, accountability, etc.).  
It's up to you to define the relationship kinds that make sense for your context.

> **Tip:**  
> The relationship kinds allow to customize the styling of the relationships, see [styling](./styling#relationship)

## Definition examples

Relationships may be nested

```likec4
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend
    customer -> frontend
  }
}
```

Relationships may have a title (and better to have one)

```likec4
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend 'requests data'
  }

  customer -> frontend {
    title 'opens in browser' // or nested
  }

```

Relationships may be tagged

```likec4
model {
  frontend -> backend 'requests data' #graphql #team1
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    #graphql #team1 // or nested
  }
}
```

Relationships may have multiple links:

```likec4 copy
model {
  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser' {
    // External link
    link https://any-external-link.com

    // or any URI
    link ssh://bastion.internal

    // or relative link to navigate to sources
    link ../src/index.ts#L1-L10
  }
}
```

Nested relationships may be _"sourceless"_, then the source is the parent element

```likec4
specification {
  relationship graphql
}
model {
  customer = actor {
    -> frontend 'opens in browser' // same as customer -> frontend
  }
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend {
      -[graphql]-> backend 'requests data'  // same as frontend -[graphql]-> backend
    }
  }

  // or use 'it' or 'this'
  customer = actor {
    it -> frontend 'opens in browser'
    this -> frontend 'opens in browser'
  }

  -> backend 'requests data' // ⛔️ Error: model can't be a source
}
```
