# Relationships

Relationships describe the connections and interactions of the elements,  
and created with the **`->`**:

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer'
  cloud = service 'Cloud'

  customer -> cloud
}
```

Relationship may be nested

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend
    customer -> frontend
  }
}
```


Relationship may have a label (and better to have one)

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  actor customer
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend

    frontend -> backend 'requests data'
  }

  customer -> frontend 'opens in browser'
}
```

Nested relationship may be _"sourceless"_, then the source is the parent element

```likec4 filename="relations.c4"
model {
  customer = actor {    
    -> frontend 'opens in browser' // same as customer -> frontend
  }
  service cloud {
    component backend
    component frontend {
      -> backend 'requests data'  // same as frontend -> backend
    }
  }

  // or use 'it' or 'this'
  customer = actor {
    it -> frontend 'opens in browser'
    this -> frontend 'opens in browser'
  }   

  -> backend 'requests data' // ⛔️ Error: model can't be a source
}
```
