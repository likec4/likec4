LikeC4 is a language, a DSL, that describes architecture as a single model and then compiled into multiple diagrams, from different perspectives and details.  

You have a _**single source of truth - your code**_.  
Any change, refinement or deprecation in the model is reflected automatically,
keeping diagrams up-to-date and synchronized with the actual state.

### Why "like"?

<Aside type='tip'>
  If you never heard about _C4 Model_, check the [website](https://c4model.com/), you get the idea very quickly.
</Aside>

LikeC4 inherits the simplicity of C4, but allows you to use your _own notation_, _your element types_ and any number of nested levels and detalization.  

Also, LikeC4 is a _**toolchain**_ that provides:

- architecture-as-a-code with native IDE support
- development server with live reload
- static website generation (<a href="https://template.likec4.dev/view/cloud" target='_blank'>live demo</a>)
- interactive and customizable React diagrams _in-the-box_
- CI/CD automation via CLI and GitHub Actions
- export to various formats:
  - PNG
  - Mermaid
  - D2
  - DOT (Graphviz)

You can use LikeC4 as a standalone tool or integrate it into your existing toolchain.

### What does LikeC4 look like?

```likec4
//example.c4
specification { // define "types" of architecture elements
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person // how to render
    }
  }
  element system
  element component
  relationship async // allow "typed" relationship
}

model { // describe your architecture, single source of truth
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    -> ui 'opens in browser' // how relationships are
  }
  cloud = system 'Our SaaS' {
    backend = component 'Backend' {
      description '
        Implements business logic
        and provides GraphQL API
      '
    }

    ui = component 'Frontend' {
      description 'NextJs application'
      style {
        shape browser
      }
    }

    ui -[async]-> backend 'requests via HTTPS'
  }
}

views {
  view index {
    include *, cloud.*

    style cloud.* {
      color green
    }
  }
}
```

Run to preview: 

```bash
npx likec4 start
```

And this is rendered (click to explore):
