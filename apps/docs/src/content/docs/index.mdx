### What is LikeC4?

LikeC4 is a powerful set of tools and a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to describe your architecture as a single, cohesive model, which is then compiled into multiple diagrams.

Your code is the _**single source of truth**_, and only you own it.   
Any change, refinement or deprecation is reflected automatically.  
No more outdated diagrams!  
And with version control, your history of changes is always at your fingertips.

LikeC4 offers:

- Architecture-as-a-code with [IDE support](/tooling/vscode/)
- A development server with live reload capabilities
- Static website generation â€” check out the <a href="https://template.likec4.dev/view/index/" target="_blank">live demo</a>
- [React](/tooling/code-generation/react/) and [Web Components](/tooling/code-generation/webcomponent/) for embedding in your website
- [Vite plugin](/tooling/vite-plugin/) for seamless integration
- API to traverse your model
- CI/CD automation via [CLI](/tooling/cli/) and [GitHub Actions](/tooling/github/)
- [Export](/tooling/cli/#export-to-png) options to multiple formats:
  - PNG
  - Mermaid
  - D2
  - DOT (Graphviz)

You can use LikeC4 as a standalone solution or integrate it into your existing toolchain.

### Why "like"?

The name "LikeC4" reflects its inspiration from the <a href="https://c4model.com/" target="_blank">C4 Model</a>
and <a href="https://docs.structurizr.com/" target='_blank'>Structurizr DSL</a>,
while extending and offering enhanced flexibility and customization.

You can _**use your own ubiquitous language**_, define your terms, and create as many nested levels as needed.

### What does LikeC4 look like?

```likec4
// You start with defining your terms and ...
specification {
  // ... "types" of your elements
  element actor {
    style {
      shape person // how to render
    }
  }
  element system
  element component
  // and "typed" relationships (if you need)
  relationship async
}

// Here goes your model, the single source of truth
model {
  customer = actor 'Customer' {
    description 'A user of our product with active subscription'
    -> ui 'opens in browser'
  }

  cloud = system 'Our SaaS' {
    backend = component 'Backend' {
      icon tech:graphql
      description 'Implements business logic and provides GraphQL API'
    }

    ui = component 'Frontend' {
      description 'NextJS application'
      style {
        icon tech:nextjs
        shape browser
      }
    }

    ui -[async]-> backend 'requests via HTTPS'
  }
}

// And finally, you define what to render
views {
  view index {
    title 'Landscape view'
    include *, cloud.*

    style cloud.* {
      color green
    }
  }
}
```

Run CLI to preview: 

```bash

```
