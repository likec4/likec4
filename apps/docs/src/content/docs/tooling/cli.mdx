The `likec4` CLI is a tool for various operations and automation, such as:

- Start development server to preview diagrams (with hot-reload)
- Build a static website for sharing and embedding diagrams
- Export to PNG, Mermaid, Dot, D2
- Generate Typescript:
  - React components
  - Webcomponents
  - Typed data

### Install

#### Local installation

If you're using it in an npm project, install it as a development dependency:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev likec4
```

You can reference it directly in the `package.json#scripts` object:

```json5
{
  scripts: {
    dev: 'likec4 serve ...',
    build: 'likec4 build ...'
  }
}
```

To use the binary, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) while in the project directory:

```sh
npx likec4 ...
```

#### Global installation

To use the CLI globally, you can call it with [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx):

```sh
npx likec4 [command]
```

If you want to use it in any arbitrary project without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh
npm install --global likec4

# Then, you can call `likec4` directly:
likec4 [command]
```                                                     

### Usage

Almost all commands have a `--help` option and provide usage examples.

```sh
likec4 build -h
likec4 gen react -h
```



#### Preview diagrams

In a folder with LikeC4 sources:

```sh
likec4 serve
# Aliases:
likec4 start
likec4 dev
```

This recursively searches for `*.c4`, `*.likec4` files in current folder, parses and serves diagrams in a local web server.  
Any changes in the sources trigger a super-fast hot update and you see changes in the browser immediately.

:::tip
You can start the process in a separate terminal window and keep it running while you're editing diagrams in editor, or even serve multiple projects at once.
:::

#### Build static website

Build a single HTML with diagrams, ready to be embedded into your website.
When you deployed the website, you can use "Share" button to get a link to a specific diagram.

```sh
likec4 build -o ./dist
```

| Option                  | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output`              | Output directory                                                                                      |
| `--base, --base-url`    | Base URL the app is being served from, e.g. "/" or "/pages/"                                          |
| `--use-hash-history`    | Hash-based navigation, e.g. "/#/view" instead of "/view"                                              |
| `--use-dot`             | Use local binaries of Graphviz ("dot") instead of bundled WASM                                        |
| `--webcomponent-prefix` | Prefix for web components, e.g. "c4" generates `<c4-view ../>`                                        |

:::note
Internally, CLI uses Vite to build the website, and `likec4 build` calls `vite build`.  
Vite [deploy documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) may also help you.

Repository [likec4/template](https://github.com/likec4/template) demonstrates how to deploy to github pages.
:::


There is also a supplementary command to preview the build:

```sh
likec4 preview -o ./dist
```

For example, this command can be used on CI, to compare diagrams with ones from the previous/main build.

#### Export to PNG

```sh
likec4 export png -o ./assets
```

This command starts local web server and uses Playwright to take screenshots.  
If you plan to use it on CI, refer to [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci) for details
or consider [LikeC4 GitHub Actions](/tooling/github)

:::note
Export to PNG requires Playwright.  
You will be prompted with a command to install it if it's not found.
:::

#### Export to JSON

```sh
likec4 export json -o dump.json
```

#### Generate Mermaid, Dot, D2

Via codegen:

```sh
likec4 gen mmd
likec4 gen mermaid
likec4 gen dot
likec4 gen d2
```
