The `likec4` CLI is a tool for various operations and automation tasks, such as:

- Start development server to preview diagrams (with hot-reload)
- Build a static website for sharing and embedding diagrams
- Export to PNG, JSON, Mermaid, Dot, D2, DrawIO
- Generate [source code artifacts](/tooling/code-generation/react/):
  - React components
  - Web Components
  - Typed data

## Install

### Local installation

If you're using it in an npm project, install it as a development dependency:

<PackageManagers
    pkg="likec4"
    dev
    pkgManagers={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}
    frame="none"
  />

You can reference it directly in the `package.json#scripts` object:

```json5
{
  scripts: {
    dev: 'likec4 dev ...',
    build: 'likec4 build ...'
  }
}
```

### Global installation

To fetch and execute a package binary, without installing it as a dependency:

<PackageManagers
   type="dlx"
   pkg="likec4"
   args="start"
   pkgManagers={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}
   frame="none"
   />


To use it in any project without [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npx), install it globally:

```sh
npm install --global likec4

# Then, you can call `likec4` directly:
likec4 [command]
```                                                     

## Usage

Almost all commands have a `--help` option and provide usage examples.

```sh
likec4 build -h
likec4 gen react -h
```


### Preview diagrams

In a folder with LikeC4 sources:

```sh
likec4 serve
# Aliases:
likec4 start
likec4 dev
```

This recursively searches for `*.c4` and `*.likec4` files in the current folder, parses them, and serves diagrams via a local web server.  
Any change in the source files triggers a hot update in the browser immediately.

:::tip
You can start the process in a separate terminal window and keep it running while you're editing the model in your editor, or even serve multiple projects at once.
:::

<Aside type="caution">
By default, the web server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1). If you want it to listen on all network interfaces, add `--listen 0.0.0.0` to the serve command.
</Aside>

### Build static website

CLI can build a website with the diagrams, ready to be deployed or embedded.  
When you deployed the website, you can use "Share" button and get a link to a specific diagram.

The resulting website is strictly bound to the given base path (`/` by default).
A relocatable app can be built with `--base "./"`.

```sh
likec4 build -o ./dist
```

| Option                  | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--output`              | Output directory                                                                                      |
| `--base, --base-url`    | Base URL from which the app is being served, e.g., "/", "/pages/", or "./" for a relocatable app      |
| `--use-hash-history`    | Hash-based navigation, e.g. "/#/view" instead of "/view"                                              |
| `--use-dot`             | Use local binaries of Graphviz ("dot") instead of bundled WASM                                        |
| `--webcomponent-prefix` | Prefix for web components, e.g. "c4" generates `<c4-view ../>`                                        |
| `--title`               | Base title of the app pages (default is "LikeC4")                                                     |
| `--output-single-file`  | Generates a single self-contained HTML file                                                           |

:::note
Internally, CLI uses Vite to build the website, and `likec4 build` calls `vite build`.  
Vite [deploy documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) may also help you.

Repository [likec4/template](https://github.com/likec4/template) demonstrates how to deploy likec4 website to github pages.
:::


There is also a supplementary command to preview the build:

```sh
likec4 preview -o ./dist
```

For example, this command can be used in CI to compare diagrams with ones from the previous or main build.

### Export to PNG

```sh
likec4 export png -o ./assets
```

This command starts local web server and uses Playwright to take screenshots.  
If you plan to use it in CI, refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci) for details
or consider [LikeC4 GitHub Actions](/tooling/github)

:::note
Exporting to PNG requires Playwright.  
You will be prompted with a command to install if it's not found.

### Export to JSON

```sh
likec4 export json -o dump.json
```

### Export to DrawIO

Export views to DrawIO (`.drawio`) so you can edit diagrams in [draw.io](https://draw.io) or reuse them in tools that support the format. One `.drawio` file is generated per view.

```sh
likec4 export drawio
likec4 export drawio -o ./diagrams
likec4 export drawio -o ./diagrams src/
```

| Option           | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`           | Path to project (default: current directory)                                |
| `--outdir, -o`   | Output directory for `.drawio` files (default: current directory or `path`) |
| `--all-in-one`   | Write one `.drawio` file with all views as tabs                              |
| `--roundtrip`    | Apply layout, stroke colors/widths, and edge waypoints from DrawIO round-trip comment blocks in `.c4` source (e.g. after import) |
| `--uncompressed` | Write diagram XML uncompressed (larger file; use if draw.io fails to open the default compressed export) |
| `--project`      | Select LikeC4 project by name or path; if not set, exports all              |
| `--use-dot`      | Use local Graphviz (`dot`) for layout instead of bundled WASM               |

:::note
Export to DrawIO requires layout. If Graphviz is not installed, the CLI uses bundled WASM; for large diagrams, install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and use `--use-dot` for better performance. Use `--roundtrip` when re-exporting after an import so the generated DrawIO matches the previously imported layout and waypoints.
:::

### Generate Mermaid, Dot, D2, PlantUml

Via codegen:

```sh
likec4 gen mmd
likec4 gen mermaid
likec4 gen dot
likec4 gen d2
likec4 gen plantuml
```

Together with [Export to DrawIO](#export-to-drawio), this allows teams to reuse diagrams in Mermaid, Dot, D2, PlantUML, or DrawIO.

### Validate

```sh
likec4 validate
```

This command checks for:
- Syntax errors
- Layout drift (outdated manual layout)

If any errors are found, the command exits with a non-zero return code.
