LikeC4 can **export** views to [Draw.io](https://draw.io) (`.drawio`) and **import** Draw.io files into LikeC4 source (`.c4`). This allows editing diagrams in Draw.io, reusing them in tools that support the format, and round-tripping between LikeC4 and Draw.io.

Use the CLI:

- **Export:** `likec4 export drawio` — see [CLI — Export to DrawIO](/tooling/cli/#export-to-drawio)
- **Import:** `likec4 import drawio <file>` — see [CLI — Import from DrawIO](/tooling/cli/#import-from-drawio)

This page describes what is mapped in each direction, limitations, and multi-diagram behavior.

## Export (LikeC4 → Draw.io)

Each view becomes one diagram (tab) in the output. One `.drawio` file is produced per view.

### Mapped to Draw.io

| LikeC4 | Draw.io |
|--------|---------|
| View (view id) | Diagram tab `name` and `id`; view title/description in root cell as `likec4ViewTitle`, `likec4ViewDescription` |
| Element id | mxCell `id` (internal); hierarchy via `parent` |
| Element title, description | mxCell `value` (title; description in HTML or in style `likec4Description`) |
| Element: technology, notes, tags, navigateTo, icon | Style `likec4Technology`, `likec4Notes`, `likec4Tags`, `likec4NavigateTo`, `likec4Icon` (URI-encoded) |
| Element: summary, links | Style `likec4Summary`, `likec4Links` (JSON array) |
| Element: notation | Style `likec4Notation` |
| Element: shape | Style `shape` (rectangle, umlActor, cylinder3, document, etc.) |
| Element: color | Style `fillColor`, `strokeColor`, `fontColor` (hex); theme/custom name in `likec4ColorName`; stroke in `likec4StrokeColor` for round-trip |
| Element: border, opacity | Style `strokeWidth`, `likec4Border`, `likec4StrokeWidth` (round-trip); `opacity` |
| Element: size, padding, textSize, iconPosition | Style `likec4Size`, `likec4Padding`, `likec4TextSize`, `likec4IconPosition` |
| View notation | Root cell `likec4ViewNotation` (round-trip) |
| Element position/size | mxGeometry `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` (from layout) |
| Relationship: source, target, label | mxCell edge `source`, `target`, `value` |
| Relationship: description, technology, notes, navigateTo | Style `likec4Description`, `likec4Technology`, `likec4Notes`, `likec4NavigateTo` |
| Relationship: kind, notation | Style `likec4RelationshipKind`, `likec4Notation` |
| Relationship: links, metadata | Style `likec4Links` (JSON array), `likec4Metadata` (JSON object) |
| Relationship: head/tail, line style, color | Style `endArrow`, `startArrow`, `dashed`/`dashPattern`, `strokeColor` |

### Not preserved on export

- View rules (include/exclude, style rules) — only the resulting nodes and edges are exported.
- Manual layout waypoints / edge waypoints — edges use default Draw.io routing.
- Layout drifts / fine position tweaks — only final node position is written.
- Theme color names — stored as hex in Draw.io; `likec4ColorName` keeps the name for round-trip.

## Import (Draw.io → LikeC4)

A Draw.io file is converted to a single LikeC4 source file (model + views). Elements and relationships are inferred from vertices and edges.

### Mapped to LikeC4

| Draw.io | LikeC4 |
|---------|--------|
| Diagram (tab) | View; diagram `name`/`id` → view id; root cell `likec4ViewTitle`/`likec4ViewDescription` → view title/description |
| Vertex: value, parent | Element title (HTML stripped), hierarchy (FQN) |
| Vertex: style fillColor | Element `style { color }`; hex → custom color names in specification |
| Vertex: likec4* style keys | Element: description, technology, notes, tags, navigateTo, icon, summary, links, notation, border, opacity, shape, size, padding, textSize, iconPosition |
| Vertex: likec4ColorName | Specification color name; element uses named color |
| Vertex: style `link` (Draw.io native) | Element `link 'url'` when no likec4Links |
| Edge: source, target, value | Relationship between element FQNs; label as relationship title |
| Edge: likec4* style keys | Relationship: description, technology, notes, navigateTo, notation, links, kind, metadata |
| Edge: likec4Metadata | Relationship `metadata { key value; … }` block |
| Edge: endArrow, startArrow, dashed, dashPattern | Relationship `style { head, tail, line }` |
| Edge: strokeColor | Specification color + relationship `style { color }` |

### Comment blocks for round-trip (import)

On import, the following are emitted as **comment blocks** at the end of the file so that tooling or a future round-trip can use them. They are not part of the LikeC4 model syntax:

- **Layout** — `// <likec4.layout.drawio>` … `// </likec4.layout.drawio>` with a JSON map of view id → node FQN → `{ x, y, width, height }`.
- **Vertex stroke color** — `// <likec4.strokeColor.vertices>` with lines `// FQN=#hex` (LikeC4 has no element strokeColor in the DSL).
- **Vertex stroke width** — `// <likec4.strokeWidth.vertices>` with lines `// FQN=value` (numeric strokeWidth for round-trip).

### Not preserved on import

- **Layout in model** — Node position/size are not in the `.c4` model; they are only in the layout comment block above. Layout is recalculated or manual in LikeC4.
- **Font style** — fontSize, fontColor, fontStyle, fontFamily are not mapped.
- **Edge waypoints** — Draw.io routing/waypoints are not emitted in LikeC4.
- **Layers** — All cells are merged into one model.
- **Non-vertex/non-edge cells** — Ignored.
- **Images** — Not supported in the parser.

## Multi-diagram (multiple tabs)

When **importing**, if the Draw.io file has **multiple diagrams** (tabs):

- All diagrams are merged into **one model** (one set of elements and relationships).
- **One view per diagram** is generated; each view includes the elements that appear in that tab (via `include` with FQNs).
- Diagram `name`/`id` becomes the view id (first diagram without a name becomes view `index`).

When **exporting**, each LikeC4 view is written to a **separate** `.drawio` file (one file per view).

## Round-trip summary

For a **round-trip** (LikeC4 → Draw.io → LikeC4), the following survive well:

- Elements and relationships with title, description, technology, notes, tags, navigateTo, icon, summary, links, notation
- Element border, opacity, shape, color (as named color when using likec4ColorName); vertex stroke color in comment block
- Relationship kind, notation, links, metadata, head/tail, line style, color
- Multi-diagram: multiple tabs become multiple views on import
- Layout and vertex stroke colors in comment blocks (for tooling / round-trip)

Font options and edge waypoints are not stored in the `.c4` source.
