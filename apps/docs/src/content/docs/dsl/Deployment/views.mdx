Deployment views allow you to visualize the deployment model, using same approach as [model views](/dsl/views) â€” predicates.

## View definition

```likec4 {17-23}
deployment {
  environment prod {
    zone eu {
      zone zone1 {
        instanceOf frontend.ui
        instanceOf backend.api
      }
      zone zone2 {
        instanceOf frontend.ui
        instanceOf backend.api
      }
      instanceOf database
    }    
  }
}
views {
  deployment view index {
    title 'Production Deployment'
    link https://likec4.dev

    include prod.**
    // ...
  }
}
```

## View predicates

Deployment views are based on same [predicates](/dsl/views/#view-predicates) as model views.  
But they refer to deployment nodes and instances.

<Aside type='caution' title='In development'>
  The following features are not supported yet or do not work as expected:
 
  - `with` expressions
  - `where` expressions on elements
  - Shared styles and predicates
  - Relationships browser, Element and Relationship Details popups (work with logical model)

  ```likec4
  deployment view prod {
    include *                            // works
    include * where tag is #next         // does not work
    include * with { color: red }        // does not work
      
    include * -> *                       // works
    include * -> * where tag is #next    // works
    include * -> * with { color: red }   // does not work

    global style applications            // does not work    
  }
  ```
