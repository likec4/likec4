Deployment Model represents another layer, _physical model_ with its own structure and elements (deployment nodes).   
It references the [logical model](/dsl/model) and inherits its relationships.

## Specification

First, following the [same approach](/dsl/specification/#element-kind), deployment node kinds have to defined within the specification:

```likec4
specification {
  deploymentNode environment
  deploymentNode zone
  deploymentNode kubernetes {
    // Nodes have same styling options
    style {
      color blue
      icon tech:kubernetes
    }
  }
  deploymentNode vm {
    // Common properties for the kind
    notation 'Virtual Machine'
    technology 'VMware'
  }
}
```

You define whatever you need to represent your deployment model and your ubiquitous language.

## Deployment nodes

The deployment model is a set of nodes, organized in a hierarchical structure:

```likec4
deployment {
  environment prod {
    zone eu {
      zone zone1 {
        vm vm1
        vm vm2
      }
      // You can also use '=' with the name coming first
      zone2 = zone {        
        vm1 = vm
        vm2 = vm
      }
    }  
  }
}
```

Node names must be unique within its container (parent node); same rules as for element names in the logical model.

Nodes can also have titles, descriptions, tags, style, and other properties just like [logical elements](/dsl/model/#element-properties).

```likec4
deployment {
  environment prod 'Production' {
    #live #sla-customer 
    description 'Production environment'
    technology 'OpenTofu'
    link https://likec4.dev

    zone eu {
      title 'EU Region' 
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployed instances

Operator `instanceOf` _“deploys”_ elements from the logical model to deployment nodes:

```likec4
deployment {
  environment prod {
    zone eu {
      zone zone1 {
        // 'frontend.ui' is a logical element
        // by default, instance has same name, 
        // i.e. it becomes 'prod.eu.zone1.ui'
        instanceOf frontend.ui
        // this becomes 'prod.eu.zone1.api'
        instanceOf backend.api
      }

      zone zone2 {
        // or use '=' with the name coming first
        ui = instanceOf frontend.ui

        // two instances of same element
        api1 = instanceOf backend.api
        api2 = instanceOf backend.api
      }

      // Deploy to any level, not only leaf nodes
      // Assume database shared between zones
      db = instanceOf database
    }    
  }
}
```
Deployed instance inherits properties and styling from the element.  
It is possible to override:

```likec4
deployment {
  environment prod {
    zone eu { 
      db = instanceOf database {
        title 'Primary DB'
        technology 'PostgreSQL with streaming replication'
        icon tech:postgresql
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deployment relationships

Deployment model inherits relationships from the logical model.  
But also allows to define specific ones:

```likec4
deployment {
  environment prod {
    vm vm1 {          
      db = instanceOf database 'Primary DB'
    }
    vm vm2 {
      db = instanceOf database 'Standby DB'
    }    
    vm2.db -> vm1.db 'replicates' 
  }
}
```
This relationship is between different instances, but same logical element.  
We don't need this relationship in the logical model, but it makes sense for deployments.

:::tip
Relationships can be defined for nested elements of deployed instances:

```likec4
model {
  component database {
    component repl_log
  }
}
deployment {
  vm vm1 {          
    db = instanceOf database 'Primary DB'
  }
  vm vm2 {
    db = instanceOf database 'Standby DB'
  } 

  // 'repl_log' is a nested element of deployed instance
  vm2.db -> vm1.db.repl_log 'replicates'
}
```
