Sometimes you may want to separate your LikeC4 model into multiple ones, based on domains, teams, or any other criteria.

You can do this by creating multiple projects in your workspace and linking them together.  
You can also use this feature to share your model with other teams or projects.

## Usage

To mark a folder as a project, create a `likec4.config.json` file in the folder:

<FileTree>
- cloud
  - likec4.config.json
  - service1.c4
  - service2.c4
  - ...
- externals
  - likec4.config.json
  - amazon.c4
  - ...
</FileTree>

The `likec4.config.json` file must have the name of the project and must be unique in the workspace.


```json
{
  "name": "project-name"
}
```

:::tip
You can use these names for the config file:
- `.likec4rc`
- `.likec4.config.json`
- `likec4.config.json`

LikeC4 interprets any file as JSON5
:::

## Exclude files

By default, LikeC4 recursively scans in the project folder.  
You can exclude files by adding an `exclude` array to the config file.

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules",
  ]
}
```

If no exclude pattern is provided, LikeC4 uses `["node_modules"]` as default.  
The exclude pattern is the same as the one used by [picomatch](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch).
