LikeC4 is model-based, and views are projections of the model, from different perspectives, scopes and details, like:

- System / service overviews
- Components interactions in specific use case
- Data flows and sequence diagrams

LikeC4 does not require to follow some rules, like strict number of levels or what should be included, again, it is up to you and your context.  

### View definition

Views are defined in `views` section.  
Views may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced):

```likec4
views {
  // with name
  view index {
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

View's name is used as a filename during the export, and a URL part for the sharing, so better to define it.

<Aside title="Default view">
  `index` is a special view, and is rendered by default if no view name is specified.  
  If it is not defined - will be generated with top-level elements
</Aside>

Views may have a title, description, tags and links (same as [model element](/dsl/model#element)):

```likec4
views {

  view epic12 {
    #next, #epic-12
    title "Cloud System - Changes in Epic-12"
    description "
      This diagram shows the high-level
      components and interactions.
    "

    link https://my.jira/epic/12 'Epic-12'

  }

}
```

Properties should be defined before [predicates](#view-predicates).  
Predicates define what elements and relationships are visible.

<Aside title="Relationships">
  Views contain elements and connections (relationships).  
  Connections represent merged relationships: direct between elements and/or derived from nested elements,
  i.e. same directed connections are merged into one.
</Aside>

### Scoped views

View may be defined for specific element (`view of ..`).  
Then, view inherits the [scope](/dsl/references#scope) of the element:

```likec4
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

  view of legacy {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'legacy.api'
  }

}
```

Also, scoped view becomes default for the element:

```likec4
views {

  view {
    // on click navigates to 'view1',
    // because it is default for 'cloud.backend'
    include cloud.backend
  }

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    include *
  }

}
```

You may have multiple views for the same element, and which one default is defined by the order.

### View predicates

Views are not static as they are generated from model. Any change in the model applied and reflected immediately.  
Two types of predicates define what is visible.  

##### Element predicates

Element predicates explicitly define what elements are visible. Element is included together with its relationships with already visible elements.

```likec4
view {
  // Only backend is visible
  include backend

  // Add frontend to the view 
  // and its relationships with backend
  include frontend 

  // Add authService to the view 
  // and its relationships with visible backend and frontend
  include authService

  // Add nested elements of messageBroker (but not messageBroker),
  // and their relationships among themselves and visible backend, frontend and authService
  include messageBroker.*

  // Exclude emailsQueue and its visible relationships
  exclude messageBroker.emailsQueue
}
```

<Aside>
  Order is significant, and predicates are applied as defined in view.  
  Exclude applies only to elements/relationships included before.
</Aside>

###### Combining

Predicates may be combined. This is equivalent to the previous:

```likec4
view {
  include
    backend,
    frontend,
    authService,
    messageBroker.*

  exclude messageBroker.emailsQueue
}
```


###### Wildcard

Wildcard predicates may be used to reference "everything", but it depends on the context.  
Assume we have the following model:

```likec4 wrap title="example.c4"
model {
  actor customer {
    -> webApp 'uses in browser via HTTPS'
  }
  system cloud {
    container backend {
      component api    
    }
    container ui {
      component webApp {
        -> api 'requests data'
      }
    }
  }
}
views {

  // Unscoped view
  view {
    include *
    // Visible top-level elements: customer, cloud
    // and derived relationship customer -> cloud
  }

  // Scoped view
  view of cloud.ui {
    include *
    // Visible:
    // - cloud.ui
    // - cloud.ui.webApp
    // - customer
    // - relationship customer -> cloud.ui.webApp
    // - cloud.backend
    // - cloud.ui.webApp -> cloud.backend, derived from cloud.ui.webApp -> cloud.backend.api
  }
}
```

###### With overrides

It is possible to change element properties just for this view:

```likec4
// Include the element and override its properties
include cloud.backend with {
  title 'Backend components'
  description '...'
  technology 'Java, Spring'
  icon tech:java
  color amber
  shape browser
}
// Include all nested elements and change color
include cloud.* with {
  color amber
}  
```

`with` may be used only within `include`.

###### With custom navigation

It is possible to define custom navigation and links between views:

```likec4 title="example.c4"

view view2 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // navigate to 'view3' on click
    navigateTo view3
  }
}

view view3 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // the same element, but navigate back to 'view2'
    navigateTo view2
  }
}
```


###### By element kind or tag

```likec4
// elements by kind
include element.kind != system
exclude element.kind = container

// elements by tag
include element.tag != #V2
exclude element.tag = #next
```

:::caution
These predicates may be deprecated in the future, please consider [`where`](#filter) operator
:::

##### Relationship predicates

First, elements are picked by element predicates, and included to the view if they have relationships that satisfy the predicate.

###### Directed relationships

Include elements if there are directed relationships (or their nested elements):

```likec4
include customer -> cloud.*
```

###### Any relationship

Include elements if they have any relationships:

```likec4
include customer <-> cloud
```

###### Incoming

Include elements that have incoming relationships from visible elements.  
Based on the model from [wildcard example](#wildcard):

```likec4 wrap title="incoming predicate.c4"
view {
  // visible element
  include customer

  // include nothing, customer has no relation to backend
  include -> backend

  // add ui,
  // because customer has a relationship with nested ui.webApp
  include -> ui

  // add backend, because visible ui has a relationship to backend
  // derived from ui.webApp -> backend.api
  include -> backend
}

// This view includes customer and ui
view {
  include
    customer,
    -> cloud.*
}
```

<Aside type='tip'>
  Relationship predicates are good for tailoring your diagrams, narrowing down the scope, and focusing on specific parts of the system.
</Aside>

###### Outgoing

Include elements if only they have outgoing relationships to visible elements:

```likec4
include customer ->
include cloud.* ->
```

###### In/Out

Include nested elements of `cloud`, that have any relationships with visible elements:

```likec4
include -> cloud.* ->
```

###### Relationship customization

Relationships can be customized per view:

```likec4
include
  // Include elements if they have any relationships
  // and customize these relationships
  cloud.* <-> amazon.* with {
    color red
    line solid
  },
  // or only directed 
  customer -> cloud.*  with {
    // Override label
    title 'Customer uses cloud'
    navigateTo dynamicview1
  }, 
```

:::caution
It is possible to customize relationships with known endpoints only  
(i.e. [directed](#directed-relationships) or [any between](#any-relationship)) 

For example, `* -> *` can be customized (in other words, all relationships on the view), but just outgoing `cloud.* ->` not
:::

###### Relationship navigation :badge[v1.10]{variant="success"}

To customize [navigation](/dsl/relationships/#navigate-to) from relationship:

```likec4
include
  webApp -> backend.api with {
    navigateTo dashboardRequestFlow
  }
```

#### Expand predicate

Expand predicate is a mix of element's and relationship's.  
Include `cloud` element and its children that have in/out relationships with visible elements:

```likec4
include cloud._

// Same as
include cloud,        
  -> cloud.* ->
```
#### Filter

`where` operator narrows down results by applying additional conditions:

```likec4
// include only microservices from nested
include cloud.*
  where kind is microservice

// only microservices and not deprecated
include cloud.*
  where
    kind == microservice and // possible to use 'is' or '=='
    tag != #deprecated       // possible to use 'is not' or '!='

// Use logical operators
include cloud.*
  where
    not (kind is microservice or kind is webapp)
    and tag is not #legacy
    and (tag is #v1 or tag is #v2)
```

<br/>

**Relationship predicates**

When `where` is used with element predicates, it is applied to the elements.    
When used with relationship predicates - to the relationships.

```likec4
include
  // only relationships with tag #messaging
  cloud.* <-> amazon.*
    where tag is #messaging,

  // only incoming http-requests
  -> backend
    where kind is http-request
```

<br/>

**Together with `with`**

It is possible to use `where` together with `with`, but `where` should be defined first:

```likec4
include *
  where kind is microservice
  with {
    color amber
  }  
```

<br/>

:::tip
Less verbose and more satisfying results are achieved with `where` in `exclude` predicates.  
For example:

```likec4

// only keep elements tagged with #v1
exclude * where tag is not #v1

// only keep relationships tagged with #commands
exclude * -> * where tag is not #commands

```

Together with [extend views](#extend-views) you may define a "baseline" view (includes everything), and then filter out in inherited views.

:::

### Auto-layout

```likec4
view {
  include *
  autoLayout LeftRight 120 110
}
```

Parameters are:
- direction: possible values are `TopBottom` (default), `BottomTop`, `LeftRight`, `RightLeft`.
- rank distance: optional, must be a positive number
- node distance. optional, must be a positive number

<Aside>
Manual changes are supported in VSCode extension and functionality is limited.  
Your <a href="https://github.com/likec4/likec4/discussions/343" target="_blank">feedback</a> is much appreciated.
</Aside>

### Style predicates

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  

```likec4
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
    opacity 10%
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to nested of apiApplication
  style apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }

  // apply to apiApplication and nested
  style apiApplication._ {
    color primary
  }

  // apply only to elements with specific tag
  style element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }

  // apply to elements not tagged
  style element.tag != #deprecated {
    opacity 20%
  }
}
```

Please note, that [overrides](#with-overrides) have higher priority.

#### Shared local styles :badge[v1.13]{variant="success"}

Styles can be shared within `views` group:

```likec4
views {
  // apply to all elements in all views in this views block
  style * {
    color muted
    opacity 10%
  }

  view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {
    include *
  }

  view mobileApp of internetBankingSystem.mobileApplication {
    include *
  }
}
```

#### Global style predicates

Style predicates can be defined globally and applied to multiple views.

```likec4
global {
  // apply to all elements
  style all_elements * {
    color muted
    opacity 10%
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style applications singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to elements with specific tag
  style deprecated element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }
}

views {
  view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

    include *

    global style all_elements

    global style applications

    // apply only to nested of apiApplication
    style apiApplication.* {
      color primary
    }

    global style deprecated

    style element.tag != #deprecated {
      opacity 20%
    }
  }
}
```

### Extend views

Views can be extended to avoid duplication, to create a "baseline" or, for example, "slides" for a presentation:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 {
    include *
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    title 'Same as View1, but with more details'

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    include some.backend
  }

  // cascade inheritance
  view view3 extends view2 {
    title 'Same as View2, but with more details'

    include * -> some.backend
  }

}
```

The predicates and style rules of extended views applied after the ones from ancestors.

Extended view also inherits the scope:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```
