Views are the architecture diagrams, projections of the model from different perspectives, with different levels of details, like:

- System / service overviews
- Components interactions in specific use case
- Data flows and sequence diagrams

### View definition

Views are defined in `views` section.  
Views may be named (must be unique) or unnamed (can't be referenced):

```likec4
views {
  // with name
  view index {
  }
  // unnamed
  view {
  }
}
```

View's name is used as a filename during the export, and a URL part for the sharing, so better to define it.

<Aside>
  `index` is a special view, and is rendered by default if no view name is specified.  
  If not defined, it will be generated for top-level elements
</Aside>

Views may have a title, description, tags and links (same as [model element](/dsl/model#element)):

```likec4
views {

  view epic12 {
    #next, #epic-12
    title "Cloud System - Changes in Epic-12"
    description "
      This diagram shows the high-level
      components and interactions.
    "

    link https://my.jira/epic/12

    include *
  }

}
```

Properties should be defined before any predicates.


### Scoped views

View may be defined for a specific element (`view of ..`).  
Then, view inherits the [scope](/dsl/references#scope) of the element:

```likec4
views {

  view {
    include api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is not found
  }

  view of cloud.backend {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

  view of legacy {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, resolves to 'legacy.api'
  }

}
```

This view becomes default for the element:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    include *
  }

  view {
    // on click navigates to 'view1', because it is the default view for 'cloud.backend'
    include cloud.backend
  }

}
```

You may have multiple views for the same element, but which one is default may be different from time to time.


### View predicates

Views are not static, they reflect any changes in the model.  
Two types of predicates define what elements/relationships are visible.  


##### Element predicates

Element predicates explicitly define what elements are visible, regardless of the relationships.

```likec4 wrap title="example.c4"
view {
  // Only backend is visible
  include backend

  // Add frontend to the view 
  // and its relationships with backend
  include frontend 

  // Add authService to the view 
  // and its relationships with visible backend and frontend
  include authService

  // Add nested elements of messageBroker (but not messageBroker),
  // and their relationships among themselves and visible backend, frontend and authService
  include messageBroker.*

  // Exclude emailsQueue and its visible relationships
  exclude messageBroker.emailsQueue
}
```

<Aside>
  Order is significant, and predicates are applied as defined in view.  
  Exclude applies only to elements/relationships included before.
</Aside>

###### Combining

Predicates may be combined. The following is equivalent to the previous example:

```likec4 wrap title="example.c4"
view {
  include
    backend,
    frontend,
    authService,
    messageBroker.*

  exclude messageBroker.emailsQueue
}
```


###### Wildcard

Wildcard predicates may be used to reference "everything", but it depends on the context.  
Assume we have the following model:

```likec4 wrap title="example.c4"
model {
  actor customer {
    -> webApp 'uses in browser via HTTPS'
  }
  system cloud {
    container backend {
      component api    
    }
    container ui {
      component webApp {
        -> api 'requests data'
      }
    }
  }
}
views {

  // Unscoped view
  view {
    include *
    // Visible top-level elements: customer, cloud
    // and derived relationship customer -> cloud
  }

  // Scoped view
  view of cloud.ui {
    include *
    // Visible:
    // - cloud.ui
    // - cloud.ui.webApp
    // - customer, and relationship customer -> cloud.ui.webApp
    // - cloud.backend, and derived relationship cloud.ui.webApp -> cloud.backend
  }
}
```

###### With overrides

It is possible to change element properties just for this view:

```likec4 title="example.c4"
view {
  // Include the element and override its properties
  include cloud.backend with {
    title 'Backend components'
    description '...'
    technology 'Java, Spring'
    color amber
    shape browser
  }
}
```

###### With custom navigation

It is possible to define custom navigation  and links between views:

```likec4 title="example.c4"

view view2 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // navigate to 'view3' on click
    navigateTo view3
  }
}

view view3 {
  include *
  include cloud.backend with {
    // the same element, but navigate back to 'view2'
    navigateTo view2
  }
}
```

###### By element kind or tag

```likec4 title="example.c4"
// elements by kind
include element.kind != system
exclude element.kind = container

// elements by tag
include element.tag != #V2
exclude element.tag = #next
```

##### Relationship predicates

These predicates include elements from the satisfied relationships only.  
Based on the model from [wildcard example](#wildcard):

###### Incoming

Include elements that have incoming relationships from visible elements:

```likec4 wrap title="incoming predicate.c4"
view {
  // visible element
  include customer

  // include nothing, customer has no relation to backend
  include -> backend

  // add ui,
  // because customer has a relationship with nested ui.webApp
  include -> ui

  // add backend, because visible ui has a relationship to backend
  // derived from ui.webApp -> backend.api
  include -> backend
}

// This view includes customer and ui
view {
  include
    customer,
    -> cloud.*
}
```

<Aside type='tip'>
  Relationship predicates are good for tailoring your diagrams, narrowing down the scope, and focusing on specific parts of the system.
</Aside>

###### Outgoing

Include elements if only they have outgoing relationships to visible elements:

```likec4
include customer ->
include cloud.* ->
```

###### In/Out

Include nested elements of `cloud`, that have any relationships with visible elements:

```likec4
include -> cloud.* ->
```

###### Directed relationships

Include elements if they have relationships of specific direction:

```likec4
include customer -> cloud.*
```

###### Any relationship

Include elements if they have any relationships:

```likec4
include customer <-> cloud
```

###### Relationship customization

Relationships can be customized per view:

```likec4
include
  // Include elements if they have any relationships
  // and customize these relationships
  cloud.* <-> amazon.* with {
    color red
    line solid
  },
  // or only directed 
  customer -> cloud.*  with {
    // Override label
    title 'Customer uses cloud'
  },  
```

:::caution
It is possible to customize relationships with known endpoints only  
(i.e. [directed](#directed-relationships) or [any between](#any-relationship)) 

For example, `* -> *` can be customized (in other words, all relationships on the view), but just outgoing `cloud.* ->` not
:::

#### Expand predicate

Expand predicate is a mix of element's and relationship's.  
Include `cloud` element and its children that have in/out relationships with visible elements:

```likec4
include cloud._

// Same as
include cloud,        
  -> cloud.* ->
```

### Auto-layout

```likec4
view {
  include *
  autoLayout LeftRight
}
```

Possible values are `TopBottom` (default), `BottomTop`, `LeftRight`, `RightLeft`.

### Style predicates

Style predicates define how elements are rendered.  

```likec4
view apiApp of internetBankingSystem.apiApplication {

  include *

  // apply to all elements
  style * {
    color muted
    opacity 10%
  }

  // apply only to these elements
  style singlePageApplication, mobileApp {
    color secondary
  }

  // apply only to nested of apiApplication
  style apiApplication.* {
    color primary
  }

  // apply to apiApplication and nested
  style apiApplication._ {
    color primary
  }

  // apply only to elements with specific tag
  style element.tag = #deprecated {
    color muted
  }

  // apply to elements not tagged
  style element.tag != #deprecated {
    opacity 20%
  }  
}
```

:::caution
[Overrides](#with-overrides) have higher priority.
:::

### Extend views

Views can be extended to avoid duplication, to create a "baseline" or, for example, "slides" for a presentation:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 {
    include *
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    title 'Same as View1, but with more details'

    style * {
      color muted
    }

    include some.backend
  }

  // cascade inheritance
  view view3 extends view2 {
    title 'Same as View2, but with more details'

    include * -> some.backend
  }

}
```

The predicates and style rules of extended views are merged with the ones from ancestors.

Extended views also inherit the scope:

```likec4
views {

  view view1 of cloud.backend {
    title 'Backend components'
  }

  view view2 extends view1 {
    include api // ✅ This is OK, references 'cloud.backend.api'
  }

}
```
