## Contributing workflow

- Decide on what you want to contribute.
- If you would like to implement a new feature, discuss it with the maintainers ([GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/likec4/likec4/discussions/new) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/86ZSpjKAdA)) before jumping into coding.
- After finalizing issue details, you can begin working on the code.
- Run tests with `yarn test` and submit a PR once all tests have passed.
- Get a code review and fix all issues noticed by the maintainer.
- If you cannot finish your task or if you change your mind – that's totally fine! Just let us know in the GitHub issue that you created during the first step of this process. Our community is friendly – we won't judge or ask any questions if you decide to cancel your submission.
- Your PR is merged. You are awesome ❤️!

3. Install dependencies with yarn – `yarn`

4. Generate sources by running build in root:

### E2E

`/e2e` contains isolated workspace. Test steps are:
- pack `likec4` to tarball
- install this tarball in isolated wokspace
- generate spec files from model (using LikeC4Model)
